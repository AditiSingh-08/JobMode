This is a full-stack React web app with AI superpowers that’s basically your career BFF.

Instead of boring job boards and generic advice, this app gives you a personal AI mentor who actually gets you. You can:

💬 Chat it up with your AI coach for career tea (resume roasts, interview hacks, and “what’s next” life advice).

📝 Fix your resume drip with instant feedback.

🎯 Find your vibe with skill gap check-ups + personalized learning paths.

📊 Glow-up your career with a dashboard that tracks your progress.

🚀 Discover opportunities that actually match your goals (no more endless scrolling on job sites).

It’s like having a mentor, hype squad, and strategy guide all rolled into one app — but smarter, faster, and way less awkward than asking your uncle for job tips.
